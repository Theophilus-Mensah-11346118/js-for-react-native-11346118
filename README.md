 Brief explanation;
 
 in task 1 I created a file "arrayManipulation.js" where the function 
 "processArray" is created to take numbers as an argument 
 and return a new modified array. 
 
 task 2 creates another function in the same file taking two parameters, 
 the numbers from the first function and another array containing strings 
 and returns modified arrays too.
 
 task 3 creates a different file also with a function,
 that takes array from the previous file to also generate a modified array.
